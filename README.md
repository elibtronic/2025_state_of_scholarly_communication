[PIE, Green, Gold, etc]

#### Green Open Access pathways?

When publishing in a closed journal there is often something called a _green pathway_ that will allow the author to either buy out Open Access rights to the article or to allow them to deposit a certain version of their article to the Brock University Digital Repository. The breakdown of what Green pathways exist for Brock author is shown in the following pie graphs.

#### Outreach to achieve Green!

The library is developing a program of contacting Brock affliated authors of Green eligible journal articles to encourage them to submit an eligible version into the Brock Digital Repository. All researchers will need to is copy and paste the DOI of their paper and upload a PDF copy to a [form]().
