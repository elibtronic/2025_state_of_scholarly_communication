# 2025 Report

# Current to Sept 11 Only!

## What is this?
A yearly check-in of some Scholarly Publishing topics at Brock University. It presents some snapshots and analysis of publishing trends at Brock University. 

This inaugural report is being released during [Open Access Week 2025](https://www.openaccessweek.org/theme). Future reports will be released in January summarizing the previous year. 

## Journal articles published

Over the course of January 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025 a total of: **402** articles have been published by Brock Researchers.

The Brock Library [website](https://brocku.ca/library/open-access/) explains the dynamics of Open Access is detail. 

The most important detail here is that Open Access articles are available to readers **without any payment**!

Sometimes a journal charges an author processing charge **(APC)** to  make an article open access. This happens for both closed journals with some Open Access content and for totally open access journals. 

Sometimes it is possible to **publish an earlier version** of a closed journal article in a place like the [Brock University Digital Repository](https://brocku.scholaris.ca/home) to have it become Open Access.  We call this having a Green Open Access Pathway.

Does this sound confusing? Well it is.

### Open Access versus Closed

The following graph show the proportion of closed and open access articles published by Brock researchers.

#### Colours of Open Access

We can now examine the the **different colours** of Open Access journals published. The pie graph below shows the breakdown of these categories versus the closed articles published.

#### Green Open Access

<!-- When publishing in a closed journal there is often something called a _green pathway_ that will allow the author to either buy out Open Access rights to the article or to allow them to deposit a certain version of their article to the Brock University Digital Repository. The breakdown of what Green pathways exist for Brock author is shown in the following pie graphs.

#### Paid for Pathways for Closed Articles

As described above we can sometimes achieve Green Open Access by posting a version of an article or by paying a fee. The following graph shows how many closed papers have at least one paid for pathway to achieve some version of open access.

#### A Free Pathway for Closed Articles

In contrast, the following graph shows how many closed papers have at least one free pathway to achieve some version of open access. This means that there is a **free** way to make **128** closed articles Open Access!

#### Outreach for Open Access!

The library is developing a program to contact the Brock affliated authors of these **128** articles to encourage them to submit an eligible version into the Brock Digital Repository. All researchers will need to is copy and paste the DOI of their paper and upload a PDF copy to a [form]().

If you published recently and fall in this category, expect an email soon with more details about this.

## APCs

Some publishers enable Open Access through the payment of an additional Author Processing Charge (APC). This is on top of regular subscription costs. All figures in CAD

- Total amount spent: **$621,484**
- Average amount per paid APC: **$3959**
- About **55%** of the published items had an APC attached about
- About **54%** of items that had an APC, had that APC paid for

The Brock Library now has a collection of Transformative Agreements with some publishers that will offer some [discounts](https://brocku.ca/library/open-access/open-access-investments/#1675264614266-ad3c5d97-5fef) to APC charges.
