# 2025 Report

# Current to Sept 11 Only!

## What is this?
A yearly check-in of some Scholarly Publishing topics at Brock University. It presents some snapshots and analysis of publishing trends at Brock University. 

This inaugural report is being released during [Open Access Week 2025](https://www.openaccessweek.org/theme). Future reports will be released in January summarizing the previous year. 

## Journal articles published

Over the course of January 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025 a total of: **414** articles have been published by Brock Researchers. The following analysis explores some details about those papers.

### Open Access versus Closed

We can divide all journal articles into two categories: Open Access or Closed. The Brock Library [website](https://brocku.ca/library/open-access/) explains the dynamics of these differences. The most important detail here however is that Open Access articles are available to readers **without any payment**! Sometimes a journal charges an author processing charge **(APC)** to  make an article open access. This happens for both closed journals with some Open Access content and for totally Open Access journals. 

Sometimes it is possible to **publish an earlier version** of a closed journal article in a place like the [Brock University Digital Repository](https://brocku.scholaris.ca/home) to have it become Open Access. We call this having a Green Open Access Pathway.

Does this sound confusing? Well it is. The following graph show the proportion of closed and open access articles published by Brock researchers.

#### Colours of Open Access

We can now examine the the **different colours** of Open Access journals published. The pie graph below shows the breakdown of these categories versus the closed articles published. Once again the the library website has a description of what these colours mean.

#### Green Open Access

<!-- When publishing in a closed journal there is often something called a _green pathway_ that will allow the author to either buy out Open Access rights to the article or to allow them to deposit a certain version of their article to the Brock University Digital Repository. The breakdown of what Green pathways exist for Brock author is shown in the following pie graphs.

#### Paid for Pathways for Closed Articles

As described above we can sometimes achieve Green Open Access by posting a version of an article or by paying a fee. The following graph shows how many of the still Closed papers have at least one paid for pathway to achieve some version of Open Access. What this means in practice is that the author(s) of the paper can pay a supplimenatary APC after publication to move the paper from Closed to Open Access. This can get expensive however. (APCs data is analyzed littler later on in this report).

#### A Free Pathway for Closed Articles

In contrast, the following graph shows how many Closed papers have at least one _free pathway_ to achieve some version of Open Access. This is great news, by doing a bit of work we can make a bunch of research available Open Access without paying any money.

This means that there is a **free** way to make **128** closed articles Open Access!

#### Outreach for Open Access!

The library is developing a program to contact Brock affliated authors of these **128** articles to encourage them to submit an eligible version into the Brock Digital Repository to achieve Open Access. All researchers will need to is copy and paste the DOI of their paper and upload a PDF copy to a [form](). Below is a screenshot of what this form looks like.

If you published recently and fall in this category of Closed, expect an email soon with more details about this project.

## APCs

As described some publishers enable Open Access through the payment of an additional Author Processing Charge (APC). This is on top of regular subscription costs that the library already pays to get access to the journal. All figures in CAD.

- Total amount spent: **$621,484**
- Average amount per paid APC: **$3959**
- About **55%** of the published items had an APC attached to them
- About **54%** of items that had an APC, had that APC paid for

The Brock Library now has a collection of _Transformative Agreement_s with some publishers that will offer some [discounts](https://brocku.ca/library/open-access/open-access-investments/#1675264614266-ad3c5d97-5fef) to APC charges.

## How do I get my research out

We have developed a new [guide]() that will help you get the most of out of your publishing. The first step is to create an ORCID, and put Brock in your affiliation, both of these steps are outlined in the guide. Then when you publish be sure to share your ORCID with the journal and your content will automatically get included in this analysis.

Please don't hestitate to get in [touch]() with us if you have questions about how this works, or if you need help setting up the pieces.


## Reproducibility

This data is built with a few assumptions involved and outlined below

- Journal content with a _DOI_ available to _OpenAlex_
- Brock researchers with a _Brock ROR_ in their [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) record


The notebooks and dataset used:

- [Data Set](Brock_OpenAlex_Harvest_Start_Date_2025-01-01_to_2025-09-01.csv)
- [Data Set Creation and OA Analysis](2025_SofSC.ipynb)
- [APC Analysis](2025_APC_Analysis.ipynb)

If you have an idea for what to add to this report please get in touch.
